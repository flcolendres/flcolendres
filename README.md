Hi! My name is Francis and I am a Computer Programming Student :)

I'm not the most skilled programmer out there, but I am willing to learn and become a better programmer. 
Currently, I am developing my C++ skills, but I am also trying to learn Python by the end of the summer.🐍

Feel free to use my projects as reference as long as you give credit. 

Cheers!
